This script is a wrapper script, that can be safely used at multiple levels (wrappers calling wrappers, if you need).

This is an example of looping through arguments and shoving them into an array, so that bash will properly preserve the fact that $thing was a single argument.

For example:
If you are sending two arguments to a program:
'one argument like this*' 'and arg 2 --like --this'

bash will turn it in to 9 arguments if your wrapper simply execs $@. 
Try it, it's really frustrating.

This script results in:
+ exec /usr/local/bin/myprogram 'one argument like this*' 'and arg 2 --like --this'

This is important when sending commands via ssh - the single quotes are required, to denote that "this entire command is one argument to ssh."
